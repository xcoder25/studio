  ├─ State management (layers, media, playback)
  ├─ Action handlers (upload, edit, delete)
  ├─ Real-time playback (60fps loop)
  ├─ History system (undo/redo)
  └─ Export system (render ready)

✅ Video Editor Utils
  ├─ File processing (thumbnails, duration)
  ├─ Transform calculations
  ├─ Keyframe interpolation
  ├─ Snapping logic
  └─ Format helpers

✅ Main Editor Component

```

### **Data Flow**
```typescript
User Action → Hook Handler → State Update → UI Re-render
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Upload    →   Process   →   Add File  →   Show in UI
  Click +   →   Add Layer →   Update    →   Timeline
  Drag      →   Opacity   →   Property  →   Canvas
  Play      →   60fps     →   Time      →   Playhead
```

### **Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
✅ useCallback for handlers (prevent re-renders)
